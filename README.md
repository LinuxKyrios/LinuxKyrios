- 👋 Hi, I’m @LinuxKyrios, one of the biggest fans of the Linux and the OpenSource world. 
- 👀 I’m interested in web application based on Ruby(Ruby on Rails), JavaScript/TypeScript(Angular, React, Vue) and Python(Flask & Django), as web applications are future of apps. In my modest opinon of course.
- 🌱 I’m currently Computer Science student, and as a Linuxer I'm learning programming C# with Mono Framework and .NET 5.0, also trying with Angular, React and TypeScript thanks to my postgraduate studies on Internet and Mobile Appplications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projetcts that includes Mono/ASP.NET (Core), JavaScript, Angular, React.

### The Linux Sith Codex by Linux Kyrios
#### GUI is a Lie. There is only Console. 
#### Through Console I gain BASH; 
#### Through BASH I gain Root; 
#### Through Root I gain Control; 
#### Through Control my limits are Broken.
#### The Kernel shall free me.
